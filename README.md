# Online_NoDB-Notes-Repository
I've come up with a simple solution of listing files from Google drive instead of working on Databases, as their maintenance can cost you charges. 
The code is self explanaratory and also simple.
Simply replace the hrefs to your directory or maybe modify the tabs that I've created.
Cheers!
